### Encryption
This app uses AES to encrypt all notes. The first time you enter the app it will generate an encryption key.
The encryption key is stored in Xamarin SecureStorage.
The key is retrieved only if the system reports successful biometric authentication or if you enter correct password.
Your hashed password (if you set one) is stored in SecureStorage as well. Change of password does not require reencryption of data.
